<h1>Mentally Healthy</h1>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>As a Mental Health and Web Development advocate, I think that having Mental Health support anytime and within reach is very important. That's why I created Mentally Healthy, a tool that you can use everywhere, any time and on any device to get support. Check it out!</p>
<h3>What it does</h3>
<p>It compiles a list of Mental Health resources and shows it in a beautiful design created by me. It allows the user to scroll through the resources and pick onw, without feeling too overwhelmed by all the choices. You can feel free to pick any category and scroll or click the numbers to see the names, links and descriptions of the resources. </p>

<h3>How I built it</h3>
<p>I used advanced HTML & CSS in order to create a beautiful design.</p>

<h3>Challenges I ran into</h3>
Being able to find every single resource and make it available through the website was a hard task, but in the end I finished it.

<h4>Here are the tasks that I had to do:</h4>
[x] Figure out the nice design and the colors <br>
[x] Find resources <br>
[x] code the entire website <br>
[x] Copy-paste the resources <br>
[x] solve bugs <br>
[x] finish the video presentation <br>
[x] write the description, make screenshots and upload on Devpost <br>
[ ] Relax and wait for judgement <br>
[ ] In the future, I will build an API to let people add resources and fill up the entire website <br>

<h3>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h3>
<p>The website looks beautiful, it is useful and works perfectly. And in just 24 hours.</p>

<h3>What I learned</h3>
<p>Mental Heath resources are very hard to find. It took me a while until I found all of the 65 resources.</p>

<h3/>What's next for Mentally Healthy<h3/>
<p>I am going to build and API so that people, non profit organizations and Mental Health Advocates can fill in their details and appear on the website without the need of human assistance, any code.</p>
